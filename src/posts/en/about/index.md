Hi, my name is Eyal and this is my personal website and blog.

I am a software developer by day and an insomniac by night.
I live in Tel Aviv, the *unofficial* capital of Israel, my home country.
I love coffee, video games and dogs (although I've never had one).
I do also very occasionally play the piano.

## Contact

Feel free contacting me via [my personal email](mailto:contact@eyalroth.com).

If you've encountered a technical problem I would appreciate it if you'd [report a ticket](https://github.com/eyalroth/blog-gatsby/issues/new/choose) on the site's GitHub repository.
If you do not own a GitHub user that is fine, just email me the good old fashioned way :)

## Data I'm collecting on YOU

This site utilizes [Google Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics)
to help me better understand your usage of this site, and ultimately,
to help me make the best site possible.
There are no ads on here.

Other than that, the site stores a cookie on your browser to remember your preferred theme -- light or dark (yeah, that's a thing, try it out).

## Comments

Commenting on posts is powered by [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/),
which is an open-source tool that uses GitHub repository issues as comments.
It requires a GitHub user to post and react to comments,
although viewing them is open to anyone.

## Behind the scenes

This site is built with [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)
and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

For more information visit the site's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eyalroth/blog-gatsby),
where the code and content are stored and maintained.

## Credits

I would like to give credit to [firmansaifuddin](https://www.fiverr.com/firmansaifuddin)
who drew my profile image from a photo of mine (revealed when the profile image is dragged),
and allowed me to use it on my site for a very fair price.
