Hi, my name is Eyal and this is my personal website and blog.

I am a software developer by day and an insomniac by night.
I live in Tel Aviv, the (unofficial) capital of Israel -- my home country.
I love coffee, video games and dogs (though I do not have any).
I do also (very) occasionally play the piano.
